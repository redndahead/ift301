<h1>Open Device Lab</h1>
<p>
  A recent introduction to the Polytechnic campus, the Open Device Lab is a place for those looking for help with web
  development. Students are able to seek guidance in the creation of mobile applications, Java script utilities, webpage
  design, and other coding related projects.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Originally founded as a grass-roots community movement, the goal of the Open Device Lab is to provide a facility to
  engage those working with internet-connected devices, and ultimately work towards improving web applications on the
  whole.
