          <p>
            Since her college days serving on the national board for the National Society of Black Engineers, Ayodele’s
            passion has been increasing the undergraduate pipelines for minority students in the sciences and
            engineering and working to increase minority representation in doctoral education and the professoriate.
            She served as a parent volunteer for the CAAAE Greene Scholars Program for two years before becoming its
            Program Director in July 2015.
