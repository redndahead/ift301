            Ayodele earned her Bachelor’s of Electrical Engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology, and
            received her M.S. and Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from Stanford University.  As a National Science
            Foundation and Stanford Graduate Fellow, she became, in 2005, the first Black woman at Stanford to receive a
            Ph.D. in electrical engineering.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since her college days serving on the national board for the National Society of Black Engineers, Ayodele’s
            passion has been increasing the undergraduate pipelines for minority students in the sciences and
            engineering and working to increase minority representation in doctoral education and the professoriate.
            She served as a parent volunteer for the CAAAE Greene Scholars Program for two years before becoming its
            Program Director in July 2015.
