<blockquote>
    "A cute and simple little Halloween treat that everyone will love. The amount this recipe makes depends on
    how many cookies and chocolate kisses you have. It just depends on how many you want. The last time I made these, I
    ended up making about 140 or so.," says Sarah Smith.
